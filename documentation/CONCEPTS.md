## Article Title and Abstract

An article title is a short, precise phrase that identifies the article's subject, while an abstract is a concise, stand-alone summary of the article's content, covering its introduction, methods, results, and conclusions to inform readers about the work's scope and key findings.

Both are crucial for article discoverability and for readers deciding whether to read the full text. 

### Article Title

#### Purpose

To be the first point of contact, attracting readers and conveying the essence of the study in a few words. 

#### Characteristics

- Descriptive and accurate: Clearly states the study's subject. 
- Concise: Short and to the point, often around 10-12 words. 
- Specific: Uses specific terms rather than general ones. 
- Includes keywords: Incorporates key terms that researchers would use to search for the article. 

#### Function

Helps readers find your article in databases and decide if it's relevant to their interests. 

### Article Abstract

#### Purpose

To provide a condensed, independent overview of the entire article. 

#### Characteristics

- Summarizes the entire paper: Includes the study's background, methods, results, and conclusions. 
- Stand-alone: Must be understandable without referring to the main text or other literature. 
- Concise: Typically has a strict word limit, often between 200-300 words. 
- Informative: Highlights the problem, key findings, and implications of the study. 

#### Function

It's often the only part of the paper many readers will see, so it must be interesting and hold their attention to encourage them to read the full article. 


## Biomedical Literature

Biomedical literature consists of published materials, such as journal articles and books, that present research and findings on human health, disease, and related scientific fields.

It encompasses detailed studies on molecular, cellular, and organ-level functions to understand health and disease, as well as the development of new therapies, devices, and diagnostic tools.

This vast body of knowledge requires structured access and analysis by researchers, clinicians, and other professionals to stay updated on the latest advancements in the life sciences and healthcare.
