## Description

AbstractGo is an AI/ML system that classifies biomedical literature using only the article title and abstract. It exposes a minimal FastAPI backend that serves a text-classification model (BioBERT with LoRA fine-tuning placed under `saved_models/biobert-lora/`) and a modern Next.js dashboard that showcases model performance, confusion matrices, category distributions, and a demo playground. The solution targets multi-label assignment across four domains: Cardiovascular, Neurological, Hepatorenal, and Oncological.

## Features

- **Model-powered classification**: API and MCP server that scores input title+abstract with a Transformers Hugging Face model (`text-classification`) based on BioBERT.
- **Interactive dashboard**: UI with metrics, confusion matrix, category distributions, performance trends, and a demo component to interact with the model and API.
- **MCP server**: MCP-compliant server based on FastAPI that serves the model and the dashboard with the same resources and tools as the API. For instructions to use it, see the [MCP Server README](./mcp-server/README.md).
- **Vercel V0 Chat**: [V0 Chat](https://v0.app/chat/abstract-go-rrzvfQyOCKc) with the UI vibe coding development. Visit this [url](https://v0.app/chat/abstract-go-rrzvfQyOCKc) to try it out.
- **Google Colab Notebooks**: [notebooks/](./notebooks/) with the model training notebooks. Visit this [url](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BU1rwp86fsX2hpAha2WIvcIZGoHq3EnU#scrollTo=6WaQOLd5Hswh) to try it out.
- **Containerized deployment**: `deploy/docker-compose.yml` with Nginx serving the client and reverse-proxying to the API.

- **Monorepo workflow**: Root `Makefile` orchestrates client and server tasks; npm workspaces for script aggregation.

### API Endpoints

Base URL depends on how you run the stack:

- **Direct FastAPI (dev)**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Through Nginx (docker-compose)**: `http://localhost:3000/api`

Endpoints:

- **GET /** or **GET /api/** (health/root)
  - Response: `{ "message": "Welcome to the Biomedical Classifier API" }`

- **POST /predict** or **POST /api/predict**

  - Body (JSON):
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "A randomized trial of beta-blockers in heart failure",
    "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficacy of beta-blockers..."
  }' \
  http://localhost:8000/predict
```
  - Example via Nginx proxy:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "A randomized trial of beta-blockers in heart failure",
    "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficacy of beta-blockers..."
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/predict
```
  - Response (array):
```json
[
  { "label": "Cardiovascular", "score": 0.95 },
  { "label": "Neurological", "score": 0.02 },
  { "label": "Hepatorenal", "score": 0.01 },
  { "label": "Oncological", "score": 0.02 }
]
```

Notes:
- The server concatenates `title + " " + abstract` and runs a Transformers `pipeline("text-classification", return_all_scores=true)` using the model under `saved_models/biobert-lora/`.
- If the model is missing or fails to load, the API returns `500 Model not loaded`.


### Secure Server Configuration

Configure your local server to use SSL so you can test payment features, since some payment APIs and JavaScript features (for example `crypto`) require a secure server.

You can use the `make ssl-certs-creation` script to create SSL certificates in the `server/ssl` directory.

Add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file with the following content:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following line:

```
127.0.0.1 abstractgo.dev
```

Then set the following variables in the client and server `.env` files:

In `client/.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN_NAME=abstractgo.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN_NAME}
```

In `server/.env`:
```env
APP_DOMAIN_NAME=abstractgo.dev
CORS_ORIGIN=https://${APP_DOMAIN_NAME}
```

## The Challenge

![Challenge Banner](./assets/techsphere.colombia.challenge.banner.png)

This project is a solution to the [AI Biomedical Classification Challenge](https://techspherecolombia.com/ai-data-challenge/) hackathon organized by [TechSphere Colombia](https://techspherecolombia.com/) in Aug 2025.

### Challenge Goal

Build an Artificial Intelligence solution to support the classification of medical literature.

The goal will be to implement a system capable of assigning medical articles to one or more medical domains, using only the title and abstract as input. You can use traditional machine learning, language models, workflows with AI agents, or a hybrid approach, as long as you justify your choice and demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Dataset

There's a dataset available for training and testing your model. It contains 3,565 records from NCBI, BC5CDR, and synthetic data.

File: [challenge_data-18-ago.csv](https://techspherecolombia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/challenge_data-18-ago.csv)<br>

## Dataset Structure

* `title`
Title of the medical article
Main text for content analysis

* `abstract`
Scientific summary of the article
Source rich in specialized medical terminology

* `group`
Medical category(ies) or group to which the article belongs
Target variable to predict with your model

### Use Case
Given a medical article, your system must correctly classify whether it belongs to one or more of the following groups:

- Cardiovascular
- Neurological
- Hepatorenal
- Oncological
